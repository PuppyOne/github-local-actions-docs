<Card title="Docker Engine" icon="external">
[Docker Engine API](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine) is required for nektos/act if you plan to run workflows in containers. This component should be manually installed using the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install).

:::caution
If you do not container isolation, you can run selected (e.g. Windows or MacOS) workflow jobs directly on your system. In this case, you do not need to have docker installed or running.
