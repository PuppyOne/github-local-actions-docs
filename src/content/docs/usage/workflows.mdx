The `Workflows` view is where you can manage and run workflows locally. You have several options to execute a workflow:

1. **Run All Workflows**: Run all workflows in the workspace.
2. **Run Workflow**: Run an entire workflow.
3. **Run Job**: Run a specific job in a workflow.
4. **Run Event**: Run multiple workflows by triggering a [GitHub event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows).
